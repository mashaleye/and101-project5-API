# AND101 Project 5 - Choose Your Own API

Submitted by: **Mojeed Ashaleye**

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Celestia** is an android app that **displays a picture-of-the-day from the NASA APOD: Astronomy Picture of the Day API**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸ“±ðŸ”—ðŸš€ **

## Application Features

<!-- (This is a comment) Please be sure to change the [ ] to [x] for any features you completed.  If a feature is not checked [x], you might miss the points for that item! -->

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each API entry retrieved (Title of images, Images, and Copyright texts)
- [x] A working Button requests a new API entry and updates the data displayed

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a query to the API request
  - The query I added is **FILL IN HERE**
- [ ] Build a UI to allow users to add that query

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the app!

## API Choice

My chosen API for this project is **https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY (APOD: Astronomy Picture of the Day)**.

## Video Demo

Here's a video / GIF that demos all of the app's implemented features:

## Notes

I learned that it can be very easy to underestimate the use of APIs. They are not as easy as they seem. They are definitely worth learning.
